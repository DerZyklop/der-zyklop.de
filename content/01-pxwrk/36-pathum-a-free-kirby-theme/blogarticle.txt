**Kirby** is a great, file-based CMS, specially for small clean pages like portfolios and stuff.

**I** am a web-developer, screen-designer, ux-blabla... you name it.

**Pathum** is a carefully handwritten, responsive Kirby theme by (twitter: DerZyklop) aka. me. It's easy to install and completely free!

I made the design and code for a little (link: http://www.pathcamp.de text: event-website). Now you can have this very basic but solid theme. You are absolutely free to edit the whole theme as you need it.

You can find the demo and download-link here:
<http://pathum.pxwrk.de/>

And there you have the documentation:

Have fun with it!

PS: I'd love to see where this goes. So if you decide to use it, please let me know! thx!
