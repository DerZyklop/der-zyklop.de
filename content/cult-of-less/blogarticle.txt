Text: > "The Cult of Less is an experiment in living with less. It is a movement and an ideology. It asks “what if one chose to live without? ” What if an entire community, city or country decided to live with less? What is really necessary? Perhaps the only way to keep up is to carry less, both physically and emotionally. In a world where all media can and must be consumed digitally, new freedoms are made available to the willing individual. As the world flattens and distances shrink, a new type of Minimalism has become possible and considered. It is the life of the digital minimalist."
