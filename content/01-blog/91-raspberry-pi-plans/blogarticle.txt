- Wait for delayed publishing-dates in germany.
- Let Google, Amazon, Apple ect. know my interests.
- Let Telekom know what i'm doing.
- Check if there is a new episode.
- Search for downloads or streams.
- See big boobs on nasty streaming sites.
- Care about file and folder-structures.

### Equipment i have

- MacBook
- Synology NAS DS713+
- Raspberry Pi connected to my TV

## The Plan

I want a (link: http://xbmc.org/about/ text: XBMC) on my TV screen and i want a big automation-system behind it that just ask’s me which TV-Show i‘d like to follow and does every further task for me. 

I’ll build the automation-system mostly on BitTorrent.

BitTorrent is a great peer-to-peer protocol for Filesharing. I already use it for example as an (link: http://www.bittorrent.com/intl/de/sync text: alternative to Dropbox). **BitTorrent Sync** is Dropbox in secure, not survailled, not commercial but the setup is as easy as Dropbox. But it‘s also a great way to get media files (with creative commons licence) like on (link: http://bitlove.org/ text: this platform for german podcasts).

My first idea was to use the NAS as simple storage and let my Raspberry Pi do all the automated XBMC and Torrent stuff. But i repeatedly read about performance-issues, when people tried to stream HD files while torrents where in proccess. (link: http://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1596yu/is_it_possible_to_run_xbmc_nas_and_torrent_box_on/c7mxev0 text: Someone wrote a script) that stops all the torrent-stuff when he starts a movie.

But i decided to use my Pi as a simple XBMC (with (link: http://openelec.tv/ text: OpenELEC for RaspberryPi) like my workmate recommended it) and let the Synology NAS do all the hard torrent-, watch-folders- and sorting-work (i’ll elaborate on that later).
