Text: `contenteditable` is a quite new attribut, that makes html-elements like a simple paragraph or a list editable. You can try it [in this Demo](http://html5demos.com/contenteditable).

I just found out that itâ€™s very useful in combination with the webdeveloper tools of your browser to quickly Fake Content on websites. This probably come in handy while presentations or meetings with your coworkers/clients. 


PS: Yes, fake content was already possible via devtools, but now you can e.g. give the ability to edit stuff to non-developers temporarily.
