Text: I've build a custom panel (backend) field for the (link: http://www.getkirby.com/ text: Kirby CMS).

It creates a html select which shows all invisible and visible pages:

After you have copied the required files from the (link: https://github.com/DerZyklop/kirbycms-pageselect/ text: kirbycms-pageselect) repo to your ``site/panel/fields`` folder, you can add the new field by typing this in your blueprint file:

```
fields:
    myfield:
        label: My Page Select
        type: pageselect
```

Once you have selected something, the uri of the selected site will be stored in your ``.txt``-file.

There are propably much better ways to write the php-part. But i think it's a good start, if you want to build something comparable.

If someone needs it, just add an (link: https://github.com/DerZyklop/kirbycms-pageselect/issues text: issue to my github repo) or send me a pull-request, if you have migrated it yourself.
