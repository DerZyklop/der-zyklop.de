I usually drink about 1 liter of water when i’m at the office. Thats way too less! My goal is to drink 2 liters minimum.

Now i just found out that i automatically drink more when i fill my water in bigger glasses. I now have a 0.5 liter glass on my table. Just four glasses of water and i’m fine :)

If that doesn’t work, then you could try this: Fill the amount of water in different normal-sized glasses each and every morning. For me this would be ten of the 0.2 liter glasses. This way you always have a direct visual feedback about your process. You wont forget to empty them.

If even this does’t work for you, then you probably have to develop you own »drink water!«-app like my workmate (twitter: mssimor) did for his android device ...lol!
