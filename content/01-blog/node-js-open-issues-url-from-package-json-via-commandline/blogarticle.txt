Title: node.js: Open issues-url from package.json via commandline

Text: When i want to work on one of my existing projects, i always do the same:

- I open the terminal
- navigate to my project
- open the project in sublime from commandline per `subl .`
- open the folder in finder from commandline per `open .`
- start grunt for all the server and watch processes
- And then i open my favorit todo-management-tool ((link: https://trello.com/ text: trello)) in my browser and navigate to the »board« with the specific project. 

It was the last step in the list that always felt inconsistent. 

I want to open the specific page from the commandline. I found out that many people write something like this in their package.json (the file that exists in every node-project):

	...
	"author": {
		"name": "[Name]",
		"url": "http://[Users Blog]/"
	},
	"repository": {
		"type": "git",
		"url": "git://github.com/[User]/[Project].git"
	},
		"bugs": {
		"url": "https://github.com/[User]/[Project]/issues"
	},
	...

I wrote a little node.js-script, which opens the bugs-url, when i type `bugs` in my terminal. The script is located in **[my bin folder]/bugs**. Now i can set up my trello-board-url in the package.json and i’m happy.

Here is the script:

    #! /usr/bin/env node
    
    var file = require(process.cwd()+'/package.json');
    var pkg = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(file));
    var spawn = require('child_process').spawn;
    
    if ( pkg.bugs.url ) {
      spawn('open', [pkg.bugs.url]);
    } else {
      console.error("--------------------------------------");
      console.error("Couldnt find the bugs-url for "+pkg.name);
      console.error("--------------------------------------");
    }

Any questions? Ask.
