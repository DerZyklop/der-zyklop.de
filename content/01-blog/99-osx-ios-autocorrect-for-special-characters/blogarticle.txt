Text: I have some automated type-corrections in my Apple-Devices, that transform the word `love` to `❤` and `apfel` to ``. Since it is a system-wide setting, it works in most of my apps and it is really easy to set up.

### Set up autocorrections in OSX

On your Mac you just have to go to your *System Preferences*, then *Keyboard* and then *Text*. Here you can type in what ever you want. 

### Set up autocorrections in iOS

If you have no Mac, you will have to go to *Settings* > *General* > *Keyboard* on iOS. 

Otherwise **your autocorrect-settings will be automatically in sync to your iOS device via iCloud**!

### Some more OSX/iOS autocorrect examples

`^tm` > `™`
`alt` > `⌥`
`btc` > `฿`
`hamburger` > `☰`
`tab` > `⇥`

Have fun! 

PS: Do you have ideas for awesome corrections? Tell me in the comments.
