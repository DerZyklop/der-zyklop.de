I searched for self hosted filesharing solutions. I wanted a quick way for me and my workmates to generate sharable, optionally password protected download links for files no matter if its `*.zip`, `*.jpg`, `*.apk` or whatever. We need this when we send large files to our clients like high quality photos, new versions of our apps, layout/design stuff etc.

I already have an awesome app for my personal, not work related files, but its not self-hosted and not free or open source. With the [CloudApp](https://www.getcloudapp.com) i see a little cloud in my task bar.

I can throw any file on it, and voila... there is a link in my clipboard.

(twitter: @mkuehnel) showed me [this link](https://github.com/Kickball/awesome-selfhosted#single-clickdrag-n-drop-upload). I took a look at all listed solutions plus the current OwnCloud version. Here is my personal top 3 list of the open source and self hosted file sharing apps.

## Linx

Demo: <https://linx.li>
Website: <https://github.com/andreimarcu/linx-server>

##### Pro

- Drag‘n‘Drop in browser
- Generated Torrent link
- Commandline Uploads possible (`curl -T foo.zip https://linx.li/upload/`)

##### Contra

- No password protected links
- No temporarily available links
- No overview UI of uploaded files
- Browser only / no Drag‘n‘Drop on OSX task bar
- It looks crappy (but it shouldn't be too hard to fix this)
- No links for shared folders / multiple files

## Nimbus

Demo: –
Website: <https://github.com/ethanal/Nimbus>

##### Pro

## OwnCloud

Website: <https://owncloud.org>

##### Pro

##### Contra

## My decision

I will set up a OwnCloud instance on my server for this. If you know any other good apps to solve this, please let me know!   
Thanks! ✌
