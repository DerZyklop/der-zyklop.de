I (link: http://der-zyklop.de/blog/synology-nas-for-tv-show-automation text: told you) that my NAS connects to the internet through a secure, encrypted, anonymous **openVPN**-tunnel. But it is hard to find pure non-filtered internet at german telecommunication providers. So they cut my payed wire everyday for a view minutes. You recognize that for example when you play a online-game with friends and around midnight all the germans are suddenly kicked out the game.

### Why my VPN gets disconnected every day

My internet gets disconnected, then my Synology NAS tries to reconnect the VPN-tunnel while there is no internet and then my NAS unfortunately surrenders. And then it has it's unsafe, easily "survailable" connection to the world till i fix it manually.

#### The solution

I installed a cron-job that checks every five minutes if the VPN is connected, and if it isn't, it tries to reconnect.

### How to set up a VPN reconnect script

Login to your NAS via ssh.
You’ll need your `conf_id` and your `conf_name`. So read your VPN-configuration like this:

    cat /usr/syno/etc/synovpnclient/openvpn/ovpnclient.conf

Your `conf_id` is in the first line. It looks something like `o1234567890123`.

Now create a new script and open it with the text-editor `vi`:

    touch /usr/openVPNreconnect
    chmod +x /usr/openVPNreconnect
    vi /usr/openVPNreconnect

Now hit `a` to start the editor mode and paste the following code block into it:

    if echo `ifconfig tun0` | grep -q "00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00"
    then
            echo "VPN is running"
    else
            echo conf_id=YOURCONFID > /usr/syno/etc/synovpnclient/vpnc_connecting
            echo conf_name=YOUR_VPN_NAME >> /usr/syno/etc/synovpnclient/vpnc_connecting
            echo proto=openvpn >> /usr/syno/etc/synovpnclient/vpnc_connecting
            synovpnc reconnect --protocol=openvpn --name=YOUR_VPN_NAME
    fi
    exit 0

Replace YOURCONFID and YOUR_VPN_NAME with your stuff and save the file bei hitting ESC and then type `:wq` and hit ENTER.

Thats it. Type the following into your command line and see whats happening.

    /usr/openVPNreconnect

### How to set up a cronjob for your VPN reconnect script

<div class="edit" id="edit1"><h6><span>EDIT 10.2016</span></h6>
<p>As Anon pointed out: There seems to be a GUI-way to do this. If you prefer command line then just continue. If you prefer a GUI, check his link in the comments.</p></div>

Just backup your current cronjob-file:

    cp /etc/crontab /root/crontab.bak

open your active cronjob file

    vi /etc/crontab

hit `a` to edit your file. Add a new line to it with this: 

    */5 *   *   *   *   root    /usr/openVPNreconnect

Now hit ESC, type `:wq`, hit ENTER, and restart your cron-deamon by using this command:

    /usr/syno/sbin/synoservicectl --restart crond

**Your done!**

Open your DSM5 admin panel, go to system settings, disconnect your VPN and let the magic happen.
