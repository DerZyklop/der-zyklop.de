Text: Tabs and spaces at the end of a line of Code is (link: https://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/121555/why-is-trailing-whitespace-a-big-deal text: unnecessary and sometimes bad). It makes no sense. At least i don’t know a single programming language where it is a good thing. Code is love and a file with trailing whitespace is a love letter written with a dripping fountain pen.

I can not understand why a lot of code editors and IDE‘s do not remove it on save by default. But in the most of them you can turn that on.

In Sublime it is a simple `"trim_trailing_white_space_on_save": true,` in your settings file (open it per `⌘`+`,`).

In Eclipse (a lot of my workmates use it) it is a [bit more difficult](http://www.codeterrorizer.com/de/php/eclipse-remove-trailing-spaces-while-saving-your-file).
