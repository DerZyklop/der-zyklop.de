Here are some SVN commands that i have to look up often.

Edit the list of ignore files and folders:

    svn propedit svn:ignore .

The ip/domain has changed. I needed to teach my working copy the new URL: 

    svn relocate https://new_domain/project/version/trunk

Yosemite has svn 1.7. Up to date is 1.8. So i needed to update lately. I just use (link: http://brew.sh/ text: brew) for it:

    brew install svn
