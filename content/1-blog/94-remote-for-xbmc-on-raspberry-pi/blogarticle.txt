### Solution 1

It is very easy to set up a remote like a smartphone or tablet app. There are many of these. I have e.g. an iOS app for it. These apps do basically all the same: You can use it 

1: like a remote with up/down/left/right/enter/play/pause... buttons, or

### Solution 3 to ∞

I haven’t done this yet, but you can setup a lot of different controllers for your Raspberry Pi. To do that, you usually have to go through the commandline.
