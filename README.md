# der-zyklop.de

This is my own website.

Its based on a file-based CMS called Kirby: <https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms/>. 
And there are some more tools like node, grunt, coffeescript and sass.

Please note that der-zyklop.de is some kind of playground for me. So there is some experimental and some messy stuff in there.
